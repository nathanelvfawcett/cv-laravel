             <p> The Java QR Code is a project that randomly generates a QR code that can be saved.<br>
               This project will be added to by implementing another application that can do tasks by storing saved QR codes in a database.

             <h2>Restaurant Order App</h2>
             <p> This application is a simple Java Swing app that allows a user to order food from a restaurant.<br>
               Since this was just a rough draft, the application doesn't send any information at this time.
